# What is this repo about ?
This is a collection of small tools that I have made in various languages, mainly C, C++, C# and asm, im listing all them becuase github will not sow the other languages because, tunez uses the miniaudio lib which is a single header file with like 10,000+ lines of code and it trumps everything else, hence why the languages show as C 99.99% or whatever.


# The Random directory
The random directory contains random, unfinished code snippets, nothing in there is perticularly useable.
It's full of quick dirty examples (and bad code)
